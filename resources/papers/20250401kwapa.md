### (2025) (In search of) regular morphology and regular meaning in Kwapa verbal number marking ###

Presented at SAIL 2025.

Yuman languages have complex verbal number marking (ex., plurality). Langdon (1992) has described number marking in Yuman as "maddeningly irregular and complex" and "impossible to predict" (406-407). The issue is that the morphological inventory of number comprises numerous exponents. Furthermore, one exponent can be associated with different number interpretations just as one number interpretation can be associated with different exponents. In this work we present preliminary findings to describe Kwapa number morphology and meaning, sorting through conflicting descriptions, finding novel regularities in form and meaning, and describing how they are used in texts, but also showing the ways in
which their interpretations are even more complicated than previously described.

### (2025) Updated version of Signaling without Saying, and ESSLLI course notes ###

Course at ESSLLI 2025.

In order to teach the course "Dogwhistles at the intersection of semantics, pragmatics, and social meaning", I have updated our recent book, fixing a large amount of errata (oops!). I additionally have here course notes, which form a bulleted outline of chapters 2-8. It could be useful!
